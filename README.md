# Covers :cd:

Prototype project using Yarn, Parcel, Netlify Functions with Express, and frameworkless Javascript to retrieve album covers from the Spotify API.

Netlify Functions is used to hide the API key for Spotify.

Building out the basics here and will probably utilize React or something similar to build out the full project as a learning exercise.

Hosted on Netlify here:
